Increases your productivity by nagging you while you visit time-draining sites.

Provide your cell phone number (US only), and a list of web sites that you would like to avoid while doing work. Nag will ping you at a set interval (default of 30 seconds) reminding you to get back to work while you are slacking off. A simple way to encourage yourself to be productive, without having to set a slew of cumbersome settings or outright blocking anything, leaving you ultimately responsible, and less likely to disable the plugin when you should be working. Works great with smart watches.
